### Intro and Plan

To someone who has not being exposed to the field, artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning sound like synonyms. This is not the case. This picture explains it with clarity:

In these notes, the focus will be deep learning. Therefore programs that don't have to explictly programmed will be the goal. The means to get to this non-explictly programmed algorithms will be neural networks. To understanding neural concepts requires undersanding several concepts such as *backpropagation*, *regularization*, *gradient-descent*. 

The goal of these notes is to summarize all the concepts in an organized manner for quick access when needed.
