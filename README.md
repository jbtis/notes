## Welcome to my notes

In here, I will wrtie down what I feel is important and well be useful in the future.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. This what I will be using to style the notes.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

1. Numbered

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
